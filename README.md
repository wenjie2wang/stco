# Course Notes

The course notes is rolling-updated before each class.
Instead of manually going to the course page and downloading the notes
every time, we may want to call a simple bash script to do the job.

In terminal:

```
bash updateNote.sh
``` 

Note that it would not download the notes if there was no
updated version available.
