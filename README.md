# Statistical Computing Course

This repository is set up for the STatistical COmputing
([STCO](http://merlot.stat.uconn.edu/~jyan/teaching/stco/)) course in
Spring, 2016. Source document for homework is posted for discussion and
reference.

# Course Notes

The course notes is rolling-updated before each class.
Instead of manually going to the course page and downloading the notes
every time, we may want to call a simple bash script to do the job.

In terminal:

```
bash updateNote.sh
``` 

Note that it would not download the notes if there was no
updated version available.


# Homework Solution

The source document for the exercise after each chapter
is (will be) pushed here for discussion and reference,
which is designed to be as reproducible as possible.
Do not hesitate to contribute if you have a better solution!
